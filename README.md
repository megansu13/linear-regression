# linear-regression


This project solves a linear regression problem using the gradient descent algorithm. To model a set of points using a line, the code finds the optimal values for two parameters: the slope and y-intercept

The output looks as follows:
Starting gradient descent at b = 0, m = 0, error = 5565.107834483211
Gradient descent after 1000 iterations: b = 0.014547010110737297, m = 0.7370702973591052, error = 1484.586557408649

I merely used his code to learn about linear regression, which I find great interest in.
